# newman-reporter-htmlextra

A newman HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional helpers to expose items like `Test Pass Percentage`. Also created a default template that can be used to show the different changes.

Also included is the full [handlebars-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) module to allow you to create better template pages.

---

This work have been hugely inspired and copied several aspects of the great work done by [Martijn Vander Vlag](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag) to create the [newman-reporter-htmlfull](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-htmlfull) package. Check out that package too, this contains many of the same features.

### Some of the Extras

- Full test runs and not aggregated stats
- New `percent` helper to expose data like `Test Pass Percentage`
- Copy and Paste any of the Response Body data
- Includes an `inc` helper to work with thing like the handlebars zero index
- More to come...

## Install
> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Replace -g from the command below with -S for a local installation)

```console
$ npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

## Usage
In order to enable this reporter, specify `htmlextra` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
$ newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-htmlextra-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output HTML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` | Specify a path to the custom template which will be used to render the HTML report. This option depends on `--reporter htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export` being present in the run command. If this option is not specified, the [default template](./lib/template-default.hbs) is used |

Custom templates (currently handlebars only) can be passed to the HTML reporter via `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` with `--reporters htmlextra` and `--reporter-html-export`.
The [default template](./lib/template-default.hbs) is used in all other cases.

#### With Newman as a Library
The CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './htmlResults.html', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            template: './lib/template-default.hbs' // optional, this will be picked up relative to the directory that Newman runs in.
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
	if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```
