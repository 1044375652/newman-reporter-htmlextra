A newman HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional handlebars helpers. There is also a default template that can be used to show the different changes, such as the `Skipped Tests` - This can be seen in all the example images.

---

This work have been hugely inspired and copied several aspects of the great work done by [Martijn Vander Vlag](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag) to create the [newman-reporter-htmlfull](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-htmlfull) package. Check out that package too, this contains many of the same features.

## Some of the Extras

- Full separated iterations runs and not aggregated stats - Default template shows iteration number in heading
- Includes the full [handlebars-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) module for building better templates
- New `percent` helper to help exposing data like `Test Pass Percentage` - e.g `{{percent cumulativeTests.passed cumulativeTests.failed}}`
- Copy and Paste any of the Response Bodies
- Includes an `inc` helper to work with things like the handlebars zero index - e.g `Iteration:{{inc cursor.iteration}} - {{item.name}}`
- Added the [helper-moment](https://github.com/helpers/helper-moment) module so you have more control over the display dates - e.g `{{moment date format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss"}}`
- Exposed the `Skipped Tests` so you can tell which ones are skipped, in the main summary view. You can also see which tests are skipped within the single request view
- Folder level descriptions with rendered Markdown syntax
- Iterations separated by tabs in the `Requests` view
- More to come...

## Install

> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Replace -g from the command below with -S for a local installation)

```console
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

## Usage

In order to enable this reporter, specify `htmlextra` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-htmlextra-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output HTML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` | Specify a path to the custom template which will be used to render the HTML report. This option depends on `--reporter htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export` being present in the run command. If this option is not specified, the [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used |

Custom templates (currently handlebars only) can be passed to the HTML reporter via `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` with `--reporters htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export`.
The [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used in all other cases.

#### With Newman as a Library

The CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            template: '<template path>' // optional, the default template will be used if one is not specified 
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```
