A [Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) HTML reporter that has been extended to include the separation of the iteration runs so these are no longer aggregated together and also some additional handlebars helpers to enable users to create better custom templates. This reporter comes with a default dashboard style template, that can be used to show the different changes, such as the `Skipped Tests` - This can be seen in all the example images.

---

## Some of the Extras

- Full separated iterations runs and not aggregated stats - Default template shows iteration number in heading
- Includes the full [handlebars-helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars-helpers) module for building better templates
- New `percent` helper to help exposing data like `Test Pass Percentage` - e.g `{{percent cumulativeTests.passed cumulativeTests.failed}}`
- Copy and Paste any of the Response Bodies
- Includes an `inc` helper to work with things like the handlebars zero index - e.g `Iteration:{{inc cursor.iteration}} - {{item.name}}`
- Added the [helper-moment](https://github.com/helpers/helper-moment) module so you have more control over the display dates - e.g `{{moment date format="dddd, DD MMMM YYYY HH:mm:ss"}}`
- Exposed the `Skipped Tests` so you can tell which ones are skipped, in the main summary view. You can also see which tests are skipped within the single request view
- Folder level descriptions with rendered Markdown syntax
- Iterations separated by tabs in the `Requests` view
- First attempt to add the `console.log` statements - These are currently separate from the parent requests but it's the first step in getting them on the report
- More to come...

This is the first attempt to expose any `console.log` statements that are really useful to have in your `Requests`. The event from Newman doesn't contain a lot of detail about the request that it was part of and this will involve, in it's current state a horrible hacky fix to map things together. In the meantime, the Postman `pm.info` function provides these for you and can just be added to the `console.log` statement, as workaround. Something like `${pm.info.requestName} | ${pm.info.eventName} | Interation: ${pm.info.iteration + 1}` will log out the missing event information.

If the collection contains Console Logs, a new tab will appear, that will show all the details. This information is displayed in a similar way that you may have seen on the `Failed Tests` and `Skipped Tests`.

A dark theme version of the Dashboard has been added to the `./templates` directory, this will have a few 'quirks' and maybe not as dark as you would like it but it's an alternative to the default dashboard view.

## Install

> The installation should be global if newman is installed globally, local otherwise. (Replace -g from the command below with -S for a local installation)

```console
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```

## Usage

In order to enable this reporter, specify `htmlextra` in Newman's `-r` or `--reporters` option.

```console
newman run https://www.getpostman.com/collections/631643-f695cab7-6878-eb55-7943-ad88e1ccfd65-JsLv -r htmlextra
```

### Options

#### With Newman CLI

| CLI Option  | Description       |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `--reporter-htmlextra-export <path>` | Specify a path where the output HTML file will be written to disk. If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory. |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` | Specify a path to the custom template which will be used to render the HTML report. This option depends on `--reporter htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export` being present in the run command. If this option is not specified, the [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used |
| `--reporter-htmlextra-darkTheme` | Use this optional flag to switch the reporter template to the `Dark Theme` dashboard. |

Custom templates (currently handlebars only) can be passed to the HTML reporter via `--reporter-htmlextra-template <path>` with `--reporters htmlextra` and `--reporter-htmlextra-export`.
The [default template](./lib/dashboard-template.hbs) is used in all other cases.

#### With Newman as a Library

The CLI functionality is available for programmatic use as well.

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            template: '<template path>' // optional, the default template will be used if one is not specified 
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

To use the `dark theme` template within a script - Add the `darkTheme` property to the `htmlextra` object. If the `template` option is also part of the object, this will overwrite the `darkTheme` option. 

```javascript
const newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
    collection: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Collection.json'), // can also provide a URL or path to a local JSON file.
    environment: require('./examples/Restful_Booker_Environment.json'),
    reporters: 'htmlextra',
    reporter: {
        htmlextra: {
            export: './<html file path>', // If not specified, the file will be written to `newman/` in the current working directory.
            darkTheme: true // optional, tells the reporter to use the `Dark Theme` template
        }
    }
}, function (err) {
    if (err) { throw err; }
    console.log('collection run complete!');
});
```

## Special mention

This work have been hugely inspired and copied several aspects of the great work done by [Martijn Vander Vlag](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag) to create the [newman-reporter-htmlfull](https://github.com/martijnvandervlag/newman-reporter-htmlfull) package. Check out that package too, this contains many of the same features.

It was also brought together by reviewing some of the feature requests, for the official Postman reporter.
